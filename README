Running AraComLex


1 INTRODUCTION

This is a shell that can run on Windows, Linux or Mac

2 HOW TO RUN

a. Download and unzip the AraComLex file.
b. Download the foma version that best relates to your operating system from http://foma.sourceforge.net/
c. Have the AraComLex files and the foma compiler on the same folder
d. Run foma from the command line "./foma". On Windows just double click on foma.exe
e. Run "source 01ArabicTransducer.xfst" in the command line to compile the Arabic finite state network. 
   After the compilation is finished, you will have a new file named "ArabicTransducer.fst"
f. To test the file, you can run the following commands:
   load ArabicTransducer.fst
   up كتاب

   To exit foma, type:
   exit
g. You can test a complete file written in Arabic script in UTF-8 using the foma lookup command
   (Windows)		flookup.exe ArabicTransducer.fst < test-arb.txt > test-arb-out.txt
   (Linux/Mac OS) 	./flookup ArabicTransducer.fst < test-arb.txt > test-arb-out.txt
The file test-arb.txt is in the UNIX file format, encoding utf-8. It works fine with Linux and Mac OS X. With Windows, the only editorƒ I know that can write in this format is "textpad" which you can download from the internet. I tried with notepad and wordpad but they damage the file.

3. Using the guesser
    Run:
	source 01BArabicGuesser.xfst
	load ArabicGuesser.fst
	up والمتسوقون
   You can also use with with flookup as explained above
